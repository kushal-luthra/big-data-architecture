### Round 1 : DS/Algo

```

1. Write a function that takes a string with alphabets a-z and A-Z as input. 
Return true if it is a palindrome. Else return false.
You cannot modify the input string or generate any extra copies of the string. 
You cannot use standard library / inbuilt function for reversing etc. 
Discuss on Time Complexity and Space complexity.

2. Write a function to find longest possible palindrome sub-string in a given string. 
Also, return the index of 1st character of this sub-string.
Discuss on Time Complexity.

```

### Round 2 : System Design
