Requirements
3 high level requirememts.
- users should be able to raise a request for cab.
- match customer to driver who is nearby.
- route cab is going to follow, and associated ETA.

Think at very high level,
our 2 main users are -
- taxi driver - tell availability through web
- client - makes request for cab through web.

need a matching system to match user and drievr.
we sgould have maps/eta service - to tell route to be followed and what is its ETA.
store information in database.
system to do analytcis - answer business quetsion like where cabs are most located, who are my prime custoemrs, fraud etc.
